# Node.js RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

This project implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system in Node.js. It is designed to manage users, roles, and permissions dynamically and can be used as a backend for RBAC-based applications.

## Features

- **User Management**: Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for users.
- **Role Management**: Manage roles and assign them to users.
- **Permission Management**: Define permissions and associate them with roles.
- **Access Control**: Verify user permissions dynamically for secure operations.
- **API Simulation (Optional)**: Simulate APIs for testing and integration.
